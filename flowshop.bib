  Abstract                 = { We describe an approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem of job shop scheduling. It sequences the machines one by one, successively, taking each time the machine identified as a bottleneck among the machines not yet sequenced. Every time after a new machine is sequenced, all previously established sequences are locally reoptimized. Both the bottleneck identification and the local reoptimization procedures are based on repeatedly solving certain one-machine scheduling problems. Besides this straight version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, we have also implemented a version that applies the procedure to the nodes of a partial search tree. Computational testing shows that our approach yields consistently better results than other procedures discussed in the literature. A high point of our computational testing occurred when the enumerative version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure found in a little over five minutes an optimal schedule to a notorious ten machines/ten jobs problem on which many algorithms have been run for hours without finding an optimal solution. },

  Abstract                 = {The majority of scheduling research assumes setup as negligible or part of the processing time. While this assumption simplifies the analysis and/or reflects certain applications, it adversely affects the solution quality for many applications which require explicit treatment of setup. Such applications, coupled with the emergence of production concepts like time-based competition and group technology, have motivated increasing interest to include setup considerations in scheduling problems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature on scheduling problems involving setup times (costs). It classifies scheduling problems into batch and non-batch, sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup, and categorizes the literature according to the shop environments of single machine, parallel machines, flowshops, and job shops. The suggested classification scheme organizes the scheduling literature involving setup considerations, summarizes the current research results for different problem types, and finally provides guidelines for future research. },

  Abstract                 = {The first comprehensive survey paper on scheduling problems with separate setup times or costs was conducted by [Allahverdi, A., Gupta, J.N.D., Aldowaisan, T., 1999. A review of scheduling research involving setup considerations. \{OMEGA\} The International Journal of Management Sciences 27, 219–239], who reviewed the literature since the mid-1960s. Since the appearance of that survey paper, there has been an increasing interest in scheduling problems with setup times (costs) with an average of more than 40 papers per year being added to the literature. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the scheduling literature on models with setup times (costs) from then to date covering more than 300 papers. Given that so many papers have appeared in a short time, there are cases where different researchers addressed the same problem independently, and sometimes by using even the same technique, e.g., genetic algorithm. Throughout the paper we identify such areas where independently developed techniques need to be compared. The paper classifies scheduling problems into those with batching and non-batching considerations, and with sequence-independent and sequence-dependent setup times. It further categorizes the literature according to shop environments, including single-machine, parallel machines, flow shop, no-wait flow shop, flexible flow shop, job shop, open shop, and others. },

  Abstract                 = {Today, a variety of heuristic approaches are available to the operations research practitioner. One methodology that has a strong intuitive appeal, a prominent empirical track record, and is trivial to efficiently implement on parallel processors is GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures). GRASP is an iterative randomized sampling technique in which each iteration provides a solution to the problem at hand. The incumbent solution over all GRASP iterations is kept as the final result. There are two phases within each GRASP iteration: the first intelligently constructs an initial solution via an adaptive randomized greedy function; the second applies a local search procedure to the constructed solution in hope of finding an improvement. In this paper, we define the various components comprising a GRASP and demonstrate, step by step, how to develop such heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems. Intuitive justifications for the observed empirical behavior of the methodology are discussed. The paper concludes with a brief literature review of GRASP implementations and mentions two industrial applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper addresses a bi-criteria stochastic flexible flow shop (SFFS) scheduling problem in which one criterion is quantitative and the other is qualitative. The quantitative criterion is the total weighted tardiness and the qualitative criterion is the importance of the customer for the company. To solve this problem, the integral analysis method (IAM), which consists of four stages (description of the problem, cardinal analysis, ordinal analysis and integration analysis), was used. The cardinal analysis implements both a mixed integral linear programming (MILP) model and a simulation-optimization approach for the total weighted tardiness solution. The ordinal analysis is performed by stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis with ordinal data (SMAA-O) in which each alternative is qualified depending on customer importance. Finally, to address the integral analysis, deterministic \{SMAA\} is applied to select those alternatives that exhibited the best integral characteristics in terms of minimizing tardiness penalty costs and timely fulfillment of due dates according to customer strategic importance for the company. Results show that \{IAM\} enables selection of the alternatives that accomplish in the best way both types of criteria. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this study, an integrated multi-objective production-distribution flow-shop scheduling problem will be taken into consideration with respect to two objective functions. The first objective function aims to minimize total weighted tardiness and make-span and the second objective function aims to minimize the summation of total weighted earliness, total weighted number of tardy jobs, inventory costs and total delivery costs. Firstly, a mathematical model is proposed for this problem. After that, two new meta-heuristic algorithms are developed in order to solve the problem. The first algorithm (HCMOPSO), is a multi-objective particle swarm optimization combined with a heuristic mutation operator, Gaussian membership function and a chaotic sequence and the second algorithm (HBNSGA-II), is a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm \{II\} with a heuristic criterion for generation of initial population and a heuristic crossover operator. The proposed \{HCMOPSO\} and HBNSGA-II are tested and compared with a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm \{II\} (NSGA-II), a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and two state-of-the-art algorithms from recent researches, by means of several comparing criteria. The computational experiments demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed \{HCMOPSO\} and HBNSGA-II. },

  Abstract                 = { This paper is a complete survey of flowshop-scheduling problems and contributions from early works of Johnson of 1954 to recent approaches of metaheuristics of 2004. It mainly considers a flowshop problem with a makespan criterion and it surveys some exact methods (for small size problems), constructive heuristics and developed improving metaheuristic and evolutionary approaches as well as some well-known properties and rules for this problem. Each part has a brief literature review of the contributions and a glimpse of that approach before discussing the implementation for a flowshop problem. Moreover, in the first section, a complete literature review of flowshop-related scheduling problems with different assumptions as well as contributions in solving these other aspects is considered. This paper can be seen as a reference to past contributions (particularly in n/m/p/c max or equivalently F/prmu/c max) for future research needs of improving and developing better approaches to flowshop-related scheduling problems. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Cleaner production has become popular since the global warming problem resulted from most industrial activities. This study proposes an environment of two-stage multiprocessor flow shop scheduling, which allows multiple identical parallel machines in each station, thus enhancing efficiency and resulting in cleaner production. The considerable research interest in the topic of parallel machines suggests that these machines may be highly efficient and effective. Appropriately scheduling deteriorating maintenance activity on parallel machines is necessary to prevent excessive energy consumption and minimize makespan, which is necessary for clean production. Improved processes in the development and use of deteriorating maintenance procedures lead to improved efficiency. Computational results indicate that the proposed method outperforms ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization with respect to the effectiveness and robustness of clean production. Saving energy can prevent excessive waste. This study demonstrated that the scheduling problem on parallel machines with deteriorating maintenance activity can be solved efficiently in an environment-friendly and economical manner. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The finite capacity material requirement planning system (FCMRP) for industrial scale flexible flow shops is known to be strongly NP-hard. Due to very long computational time, the exact method can be inappropriate for this problem. In this paper, a new hybrid improvement algorithm for the \{FCMRP\} system in a flexible flow shop with assembly operations is proposed. The proposed algorithm is a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and tabu search (TS) called HGATS. There are six primary steps in HGATS. In step 1, a production schedule is generated by variable lead-time \{MRP\} (VMRP). In step 2, dispatching and random rules are applied to generate initial sequences of orders. From step 3 to step 5, the sequences of orders are iteratively improved by characteristics of \{TS\} and GA. Finally, the start times of operations are optimally determined by linear programming. The results show that \{HGATS\} outperforms GA, \{TS\} and the existing algorithm. Furthermore, \{HGATS\} requires a practical computational time when applied to real industrial cases. },

We restrict ourselves to basic problems: the processing times are fixed, there are neither set-up times nor due dates nor release dates, etc. Then, the objective is the minimization of the makespan.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The integration of energy efficiency at both machine tool and shop floor levels could bring multiple environmental benefits. In order to explore the potential on energy saving for shop floor management, a multi-level optimization method for energy-efficient flexible flow shop scheduling is proposed, which incorporates power models of single machine and cutting parameters optimization into the energy-efficient scheduling problems. The operation scheme is obtained through multi-level optimization, namely cutting parameters optimization (machine tool level) and optimized scheduling (shop floor level). At machine tool level, cutting parameters of each machine are optimized based on grey relational analysis, where cutting energy and cutting time are considered as the objectives. Based on the established energy consumption model of flexible flow shop, Genetic Algorithm is employed to optimize makespan and total energy consumption simultaneously at shop floor level. The case study for a flexible flow shop is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multi-level optimization method. The scheduling results show that the multi-level optimization method is effective in assisting schemes selection to reduce the makespan and total energy consumption during production process. Moreover, there exists potential for synergistic energy saving when the multi-level optimization is used. },

The job can be processed on at most one machine; meanwhile one machine can process at most one job. The most common objective for this problem is makespan. However, many real-world scheduling problems are multi-objective by nature. Over the years there have been several approaches used to deal with the multi-objective flow shop scheduling problems (MOFSP). Hence, in this study, we provide a brief literature review of the contributions to \{MOFSP\} and identify areas of opportunity for future research. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A permutation flow shop scheduling problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program after incorporating flexible and diverse maintenance activities for minimizing total tardiness and maintenance costs. The terms “flexible” and “diverse” mean that the maintenance activities are not required to perform following fixed and predetermined time intervals, and there can be different types of maintenance activities for each machine. The problem is proved to be NP-hard and a lower bound for the problem is proposed. A lower-bound-based genetic algorithm (LBGA) is presented, in which the algorithm parameters are first tested through a factorial experiment to identify the statistically significant parameters. The \{LBGA\} algorithm self-tunes these parameters for its performance improvement based on the solution gap from the lower bound. While it is experienced that only the population size is statistically significant in improving the quality of solutions, through a computational experiment it is also shown that an optimal population size for one problem size yields the same quality of solutions for larger sizes of problems and increasing the population size beyond the optimal size for larger sizes of problems will only negatively affects the efficiency of the algorithm. Computational results that show efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm are also provided. },
